      <h1>About the project</h1>
      <h2>The university</h2>
      <p>Edinburgh Napier University is a public university in Edinburgh and has three different campus (Merchiston, Craiglockhart and Sighthill) and more than 300 courses.</p>
      <h2>The module</h2>
      <p>The Web Technologies module is focused on the tools and technologies involved in the client side of the web, that is everything that happens in the browser.</p>
      <h2>The project</h2>
      <p>This website is part of a project for the Web Technologies module of Edinburgh Napier University. </p>
      <p>The project is to develop a website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a "choose your own adventure" game style.</p>
      <p>This type of game sees the player reading a part of the storyline and selecting between a few different options presented on the screen to develop it and continue it.<br>
      In this way, depending on the choices of the player, the story can have different evolutions or perhaps different outcomes.</p>
      <p>The adventure presented in this website sees the reader stepping into my shoes and living one day as if he were me, choosing between the different actions which I can normally take on a typical summer day in my little island in northern Italy.</p>
      <p>The storyline starts with the reader waking up and deciding if breakfast should be had at home or outside at a local kiosk, and it will then continue differently depending on this first choice.</p>
      <p>The website is divided into 5 pages, and "play" is the page where the island activities happens.</p>
